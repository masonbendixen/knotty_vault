# Overview
Obsidian has templates that can be applied to notes that either already exist or to create a new note based on a template with the Quick Add core plugin. Templates are basically notes that have very limited replacement variables that are filled in when the template is applied. The Templater community plugin is a separate entity that is much more powerful and complicated and has a large API accessible from Javascript that can do a lot more but is much harder to use and potentially dangerous.

# Setup Instructions
- In general, create a folder to house your templates (like Templates) and then set the Template directory setting to point to this directory.
- Add notes that will be "templates" to this directory and use the limited replacement variables as needed.
- Enable the Quick Add plugin and then add various options to create various entities and choose the appropriate template to use.
- Invoke Quick Add and choose your option or choose to create a hotkey for the entity you created.
